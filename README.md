This is the repository for PIPR (originally Lasagna in our previous preprint version). This repository contains the source code and links to some datasets used in our paper.

Environment:

    python 2.7 or 3.6
    Tensorflow 1.7 (with GPU support)
    CuDNN
    Keras 2.2.4
    
./binary contains the implementation for the binary prediction task. This includes scripts to run on three datasets: Yeast, Human and multi-species.    
./type contains that for the interaction type prediction task.  
./regression contains that for the binding affinity prediction task. 
Each folder is attached with a **run.sh** to show how to run the evaluation program.  
./embeddings contains pre-trained amino acid embeddings and the training script.  

## Datasets

Here we include altogether 6 datasets. New datasets processed in this work are marked *ND*.  
1. The Yeast dataset for binary PPI prediction provided in [Guo et al. 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2396404/).  
2. The *multi-species dataset (C. elegans, D. melanogaster and E. coli)* extracted from DIP for binary PPI prediction. (*ND*)  
3. Added another binary PPI prediction dataset from [Pan et el. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20698572) under the folder *sun*.  
4. The SHS27k dataset for interaction type prediction can be downloaded from [here](http://yellowstone.cs.ucla.edu/~muhao/pipr/SHS_ppi_beta.zip) or from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y_5gje6AofqjrkMPY58XUdKgDuu1mZCh). (*ND*)  
5. The larger SHS148k dataset for interaction type prediction can be found in the links above. (*ND*)  
6. Link to the normalized SKEMPI dataset is [here](http://yellowstone.cs.ucla.edu/~muhao/pipr/SKEMPI_all_dg_avg_(PIPR).zip).
